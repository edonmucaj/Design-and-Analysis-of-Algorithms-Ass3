# Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Assignment 3

## Running the Coloring Algorithm Script

To execute the coloring algorithm, open your terminal and follow these steps:

1. **Basic Execution:**  
   Type the following command to run the script:<br/>
   `python3 coloring_algorithm.py`

2. **Redirecting Output to a File:**  
   If you wish to save the output to a file instead of displaying it in the terminal, use this command:<br/>
   `python3 coloring_algorithm.py > result.txt`<br/>
   This will create a file named result.txt in the current directory, containing the output of the script.
